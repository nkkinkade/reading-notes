# Read: 12 - Docs for the HTML <canvas> Element & Chart.js

## Chart.js
* Chart.js is a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5â€™s canvas element to draw a graph onto the page
* There are a few options for charts on a page using chart.js:
  * Line charts
  * Pie charts
  * Bar charts
  * Grids
* The < canvas > tag is used to place a chart in HTML

## Canvas
* The < canvas > element has only two attributes, width and height
* The < canvas > element can be styled just like any normal image (like bargin, border, etc.)
* Providing fallback content can make it so that older browsers that don't support canvas still get the information
* The < canvas > tag requires a closing tag
* Circles can be drawn using arc() or arcTo()
* The Path2D() constructor returns a newly instantiated Path2D object, optionally with another path as an argument (creates a copy), or optionally with a string consisting of SVG path data
