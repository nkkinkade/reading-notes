# Read: 02 - HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript

## HTML
* Headings are used to indicate the start of new information and have 6 levels of importance from < h1 > to < h2 >
* Paragraphs contain text on a page and use < p > tags to convey that text
* < b > tags can be used to __bold__ text and < i > tags can be used to _italicize_ text
* Line breaks can be created using the < br / > tag

## CSS
* CSS is used to add style rules to HTML elements
* CSS rules contain 2 parts:
  * Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to
  * Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled and are made up of 2 parts:
    * Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change, i.e. color, font, width, height, and border
    * Values specifiy the settings you want to use for the chosen properties
* To connect HTML to CSS stylings there are 2 methods:
  * < link > tags link to a separate file where the CSS lives
  * < style > tags allow you to put stylings directly into your HTML

## JavaScript
* JavaScript gives a browser instructions of how it should respond based on user input through scripts
* Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement
* Comments can be added to your JavaScript that won't show up on the webpage by surrounding text with /* */
* Variables are used to hold data values and can be changed at any time
* Variables must first be declared before you can assign a value to them
* Data types in JavaScript are as follows:
  * Numbers are just numbers, example: 243
  * Strings have letters, numbers, and other characters and are surrounded by single quotations: 'string'
  * Boolean data types will have 1 of 2 values: true or false
* If statements check a condition to see if it is __true__. If __true__ any statements in a following code block are executed
  * If the If statement is __false__ an Else statement can be added and that code block will be used instead
