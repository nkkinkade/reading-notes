# Read: 08 - More CSS Layout

## CSS Layout
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box, either block-level box or inline box
  * Block-level elements will start a new line
  * Inline elements flow in between surounding text
* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:
  * Normal flow is the default positioning scheme; block-level elements appear one after the other, vertically down the page
  * Relative Positioning moves an element from where it would normally be positioned, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left
  * Absolute Positioning takes elements out of the normal flow and move as users scroll up and down the page
