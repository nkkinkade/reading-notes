# Read: 09 - Forms and Events

## Forms
* There are various different kinds of form controls that can be used:
  * Text input is used for a single line of text such as an email address
  * Password input is like text input but masks the characters entered
  * Text area is used for longer areas of text, such as messages and comments
  * Radio buttons are used when a user must select one of a number of options
  * Checkboxes are used for when a user can select and unselect one or more options
  * Drop-down boxes are used to select one option from a list
  * Submit buttons are used to submit data from your form to another web page
  * Image buttons are similar to submit buttons but an image can be used
  * File upload allows users to upload files to a website
* The < form > tag is used to start the code for a form
* The < input > element is used to create several different form controls

## Lists & tables
* There are two different ways to order lists:
  * Unordered lists use the < ul > tag and use bullet-points (which can be be changed or even taken off entirely)
  * Ordered lists use the < ol > tag and use some form of numbering, usually 1, 2, 3, etc. but can be used with letters (upper and lower-case) as well as roman numerals
* Markers can be positioned by using list-style-position with either outside or inside values
* Tables can be made in HTML and have the look changed in CSS with such properties as width, padding, text-transform, font-size, border, text-align, etc.

## Events
* Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened
* Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon
* When an event occurs on a an element it can trigger a JavaScript function
* Event delegations can be used to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element
