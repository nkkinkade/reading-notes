# Read: 04 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## HTML Links
* Links are created using the < a > tag
* To link to another page on the same site simply add the location of the file such as "index.html" inside the opening < a > tag
* To link to an external page you need the full address such as "https://google.com"
* To link to an email address you would use "mailto:user@example.com"

## CSS Layout
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box, either block-level box or inline box
  * Block-level elements will start a new line
  * Inline elements flow in between surounding text
* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:
  * Normal flow is the default positioning scheme; block-level elements appear one after the other, vertically down the page
  * Relative Positioning moves an element from where it would normally be positioned, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left
  * Absolute Positioning takes elements out of the normal flow and move as users scroll up and down the page

## Functions
* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specifc task
* To declare a function you must start with the "function" keyword followed by a function name
* Function names must be followed with open and closed paranthesis, for example: functionName()
* Function names are used to "call" a function as well
* Functions can be used to get single and multiple values
