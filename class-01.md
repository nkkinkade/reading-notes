## HTML basics
* Elements describe the structure of a page using tags
* Each element has an opening and closing tag
  * Tags look like this: <p></p>
  * Content goes between the opening and closing tags
* Attributes provide additional information about contents of an element and is made up of two parts:
  * Name of the attribute
  * Value of the attribute
* To recall a specific element using CSS you can use an ID attribute
* Class attributes let you change the style of every member of a class using CSS
* HTML5 allows for less cluttered code, of note the div tag has become obsolete
* Wireframes help visualize how your webpage should look

## JavaScript
* JavaScript is a text language like HTML and CSS
* It uses scripts to tell a page what to do when a certain action is performed
* The script element is used in HTML to tell the bowser to load JavaScript files
* JavaScript can be written into HTML, but it's best to keep it on it's own file
