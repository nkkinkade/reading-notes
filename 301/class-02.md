# Read: 02 - jQuery, Events, and The DOM

## JQuery
* JQuery is a JavaScript file that lets you find elements using css-style selectors and then do something with the elements using methods
* JQuery must be imported using a script tag in HTML
* JQuery shortens code in JavaScript to use less lines of code
* Chaining can be used to place several methods in the same selector
* .html retrieves only the HTML inside the first element in the matched set, along with any of it's descendents

## Pair Programming
* Pair programming is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills
* Pair programming commonly involves two roles:
  * The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard
  * The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer
* Pair programming touches on four skills:
  * Developers explain out loud what the code should do
  * Developers listen to othersâ€™ guidance
  * Developers read code that others have written
  * Developers write code themselves
