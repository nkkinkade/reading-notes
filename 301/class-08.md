## SQL
* SQL stands for Structured Query Language
* SQL is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database
* There are many popular SQL databases:
  * SQLite
  * MySQL
  * Postgres
  * Oracle
  * Microsoft SQL Server
* A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables
  * Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns and any number of rows of data
* To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write __SELECT__ statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries
* A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned
